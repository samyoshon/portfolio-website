							<h2>COOKING TRAILERS**</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Cooking Trailers was created to tackle the question 'Why don't people cook?' We believed that the reason people are not cooking was not because they think cooking is difficult, but because they think cooking takes longer than it does. Therefore, the goal of this app is to breakdown the perception of cooking as a tedious and time-consuming activity.
							<br><br>
							By utilizing sped-up videos, we created an app that would quickly walk the users through the steps of a recipe. In doing so, we believe people's perception of cooking has become more positive.

							<h2>ORDER-WHAT APP**</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Yelp does a great job in letting me know which restaurants I should check out. However, there is still a pain point in trying to discover what dish to order at the recommended restaurant. Therefore, the goal of this app is to make the food ordering process faster and easier by providing users with a user-generated list of the restaurant's most popular items.
							<br><br>
							By utilizing a similar upvote-downvote concept found on Reddit, I created an app that would allow users to vote on individual dishes at restaurants. In doing so, users would no longer need to read through many of the Yelp users' critiques, but could quickly know which dishes were the most popular at a restaurant.

							<h2>LAY-A-CAKE**</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Lay-a-cake is a fun, two-player game. The objective of the game is to work with your 'co-pastry chef' to stack the cake as high as possible. The part of the cake that doesn't land on the cake below gets cut off, making the game more difficult after every layer of cake. Yum!

							<h2>JETPATH - Under Construction</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Why doesn't the United States have a gap year like the Europeans and Australians? After traveling abroad, I wished there was a platform that allowed me to take a gap year. Therefore, the goal of this app is two-fold: first, to breakdown the fear of living abroad and second, to make job opportunities abroad more accessible. 
							<br><br>
							By utilizing Angular's power, I was able to quickly create a template that allowed potential employees to filter and search through job openings, while simultaneously providing future employers an easy way to post new job opportunities.
